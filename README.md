# RealTimeObjectDetection
Python program utilising OpenCV DNN to detect objects video feed and draw bounding boxes. Works on SSD Mobilenet / YOLO.
Used multi threading to increase speed of input capture from webcam to more than 100FPS, so that comparitively lesser lag is observed.

## Example output
*Kindly note it's an image of a car on a mobile phone*

<img src = images/car.png height = 300>

Execute with **python try11.py** to detect objects from webcam feed.
